# Every Genere Maker

A project to automatically generate and then manually curate a list of genres.

## Roadmap

- Add genres, styles and "unique genres" to three separate lists in an editor panel.
- Automatically generate a list of possible genre combinations as strings in an output panel.
- Allow genre-style results to be curated using a toggle to enable / disable them.
- The curated list can be exported as XML or CSV
